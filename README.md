#### My roles were to create the functionality for the SignUp Page

+ What was the biggest challenge? The biggest challenge to me was creating the ViewModel for the SignUpPage
+ Why was it a challenge? It was a challenge because it was my first time dong it and my first time hearing about it.
  + How was the challenge addressed? I addresed the challenged by using youtube videos and watching tutorials how a ViewModel works.
  + In addition, going to stackoverflow if there were people asking similar questions such as "What is a ViewModel". 
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project? Favorite thing that I liked to do in this project was connecting the database to the signup and actually inserting users into the database. Basically, seeing how everything connect to one another.
+ If you could do it over, what would you change? One thing I would change is making a different file for the Activity & the Compose since that is the best practice, unfortunately I did the opposite and created them in a single file
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned? The most valuable thing I learned is communcation is a big thing in group project because without it, it could get messy and confusion starts to happen.

  + Managing pull requests and merges
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + We were all new to git/github and not everyone followed convention
  + How was the challenge addressed?
  + I went to the TA for help and used ChatGPT and web resources to get more comfortable with git.
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + Finally getting the IDs from the API calls to store in the ROOM database
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would get the ROOM database setup FIRST

## Conclusion

- The project is pretty successful in our opinion because we were able to make the database to work as well as the API
- The largest victory is getting everything to work together, and getting the main priorities done such as creating database, creating the layout, and the API working
- The project ... final assessment INSERT HERE
